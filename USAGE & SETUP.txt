Create a .env file containing the following values:

SHOPIFY_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY'
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY='YOUR_SECRET'

After setting up the project, go to:
https://7b0a7dc4.ngrok.io/auth?shop=surflyfe.myshopify.com

Which is:
https://<YOUR_NGROK_URL>/auth?shop=<YOUR_DEV_SHOP>.myshopify.com

That will install the application on your store and show the main page.

Then you can interact with it by going to Apps/<your-app>
